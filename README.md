# Project-8 Computer Vision Applications in Transportation Engineering

This repository contains all assignments associated with the project Computer Vision Application in Transportation Engineering offered by the Society of Civil Engineers (SOCE).

- Implemented the logistic regression model from scratch to perform binary classification between the crack and non-crack.
- Evaluated the accuracy using F1 score of training, validation, and test dataset, plotted relation between loss and epotchs.
- Used OpenCV for processing the images and built Custom Trackbars for manipulating the different attributes of the images.
- Utilized OpenCV to detect and track moving motor vehicles in different videos within a given Region of Interest (ROI).
