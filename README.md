This repository contains all assignments associated with the project Computer Vision Application in Transportation Engineering offered by the Society of Civil Engineers (SOCE) as a Summer Project.

##### Name : Aman Kumar Singh
##### Roll No : 200100


#### Description
- Implemented the logistic regression model from scratch in order to perform binary classification between the crack and non-crack.
- Evaluated the accuracy by using the F1 score of training, validation, and test dataset, plotted relation between loss and epotchs.
- Utilised OpenCV for processing of the images and built Custom Trackbars for manipulating the different attributes of the images.
- Used OpenCV to detect and track moving automobiles throughout a variety of videos within a given Region of Interest (ROI).
- Built different Deep Learning Architectures like ANNs and CNNs for Traffic Signs Classification and compared these architectures
